    "- **We first formally defined our hypothesis and null hypothesis.**   \n",

    "- **We then asked 2 key questions abour our data and then used the results of these tests to choose the most appropriate test for each hypotheses.**\n",
    "\n",
    "    1. **How many samples will I be comparing?**\n",
    "        - 1 group vs a idealized distribution?\n",
    "        - 2 groups?\n",
    "        - More than 2?\n",
    " \n",
    "    2. **Do we need a 1-tailed or 2-tailed test? In other words, is there an expected directionality to our hypothesis?**\n",
    "        - Are we asking if group A will be have larger/higher values than Group B?\n",
    "        - Or are we just asking if the 2 groups are different?-   \n",
    "\n",
    "    3. **Is our data normally distributed?**\n",
    "        - Does our data meet the required assumption of normality?\n",
    "\n",
    "    4. **Is the variance in our data approximately equal?**\n",
    "        - Is there an equal spread to the different samples of data?\n",
    "\n",
    "- **We then selected the appropriate test based upon these criteria.**\n",
    "    - For significant results, we then calculated the effect size using Cohen's d.\n",
    "    - We additionally ran post-hoc tests for pairwise comparisons for any hypothesis that had more than 2 groups.\n",

    "- Aim 1:To select the proper dataset for analysis, perform EDA, and generate data groups for testing.\n",
    "    - Use SQL Alchemy with Pandas DataFrames to retrieve and merge/join data from proper SQL tables.\n",
    "    - Perform any calculations of engineer any features required to test our hypothesis. \n",
