    "## Introduction / Project Assignment\n",
    "\n",
    "**For this project, we were hired by the Northwind company allowed us access to their SQL databases to answer a specific question:**\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Do discounts have a statistically significant effect on the number of products customers order? If so, at what level(s) of discount?”**\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, we were tasked with thinking of  3 other questions that would be of interest to the company.\n",
    "They requested we formally apply hypothesis testing for our results to see if we could the null hypothesis, that there is no effect of discounts on quantities purchased.\n",
    "    \n",
    "After considering their initial question and examining their databases, we decided that the company would be interested in understanding other aspects of consumer purchasing behavior. We then formulated 3 addititional questions along those lines.\n",

    "## Four Hypotheses Regarding Consumer Purchasing Behavior\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Q1:\"Do discounts have a statistically significant effect on the number of products customers order?  If so, at what level(s) of discount?** \n",
    "\n",
    "    - Null Hypothesis (H0) : Products that are discounted sell the same quantities as full-proce products.\n",
    "    - Alternative Hypothesis (H1): Products that are discounted sell in higher quantities.\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "* **Q2: Do customers spend more money overall if they are buying discounted items?**\n",
    "    - H1: Customers spend more money overall when their order includes discounted items.\n",
    "    - H0: Customers spend the same amount regardless of discounted items. \n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",

    "    - H1 = The month an order is placed relates to either a higher or lower mean quantity of items sold.\n",
    "    - H0 = The month of an order has no affect on the mean quantity of items sold.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Q4:  Do countries that buy discounted items in higher-than-average quantities spend more money (have higher order totals)?**\n",

    "## Our Methodology\n",
    "- **We first formally defined our hypothesis and null hypothesis.**   \n",
    " <br>\n",
    "- **We then asked 2 key questions abour our data and then used the results of these tests to choose the most appropriate test for each hypotheses.**\n",
    "\n",
    "    1. **How many samples will I be comparing?**\n",
    "        - 1 group vs an idealized distribution?\n",
    "        - 2 groups?\n",
    "        - More than 2?\n",
    " \n",
    "    2. **Do we need a 1-tailed or 2-tailed test? In other words, is there an expected directionality to our hypothesis?**\n",
    "        - Are we asking if group A will be have larger/higher values than Group B?\n",
    "        - Or are we just asking if the 2 groups are different?-   \n",
    "\n",
    "    3. **Is our data normally distributed?**\n",
    "        - Does our data meet the required assumption of normality?\n",
    "\n",
    "    4. **Is the variance in our data approximately equal?**\n",
    "        - Is there an equal spread to the different samples of data?\n",
    "\n",
    "- **We then selected the appropriate test based upon these criteria.**\n",
    "    - For significant results, we then calculated the effect size using Cohen's d.\n",
    "    - We additionally ran post-hoc tests for pairwise comparisons for any hypothesis that had more than 2 groups.\n",
